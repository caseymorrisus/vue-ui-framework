# Vue.js UI Framework [WIP]

This is a very rough build and is in no way meant to be used in production. 

> **Todos:**

> - Convert use of `$el` to `$refs` in unit tests (deprecated in Vue.js 2.0)
> - Complete full unit test coverage for current components
> - Clean up components
> - Make styles consistent
> - Continue adding components


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests (WIP)
npm run unit

# run e2e tests (None added yet)
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
